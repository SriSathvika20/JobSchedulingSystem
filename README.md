This project is a simple "Job Scheduling System in Java" that allows users to schedule tasks to run at specific times. Users can define a job schedule as "hourly", "daily", or "weekly" through
console input. Once the user provides the schedule details, the system continuously checks the current time and automatically triggers the job to print, based on the user's input.
This project uses manual time tracking with basic Java constructs(Concept of Threads) . A separate thread runs an infinite loop that continuously checks the current system time and triggers the job when the specified condition is met.
